Shared logger infrastructure
----------------------------

I had a need for an easy-to-use logger across my various NodeJS projects.  This is it.  If you like it, feel free also to use it.  When I make releases, I push them to npm @hughescr/logger and that is probably the best/safest way to consume this package.  The `develop` branch and other github stuff might break compatibility at any time.  `master` is for releases and is what will be on npm at any given point in time, tagged with release numbers.
